# LittleLemonAPI Project

This repository contains the source code for the LittleLemonAPI project, a fully functioning API developed for the Little Lemon restaurant. The project enables client application developers to build web and mobile applications, allowing users with different roles to perform various tasks such as browsing, adding and editing menu items, placing orders, and managing deliveries.

**PS1.** This is my inaugural project, and it's possible that you might encounter some errors :)

**PS2.** Project requirements on the course were a little bit confusing and even the solution code provided after we submitted the task doesn't meet the requirements but it was clean and DRY. Anyway valuable experience

Project Overview
----------------

### Scope

The project encompasses the creation of a Django app named LittleLemonAPI, where all API endpoints are implemented. Dependencies are managed using pipenv within a virtual environment. The use of class-based views is encouraged, adhering to proper API naming conventions.

### User Groups

Two user groups, "Manager" and "Delivery Crew," are created using Django admin. Users not assigned to any group are considered customers.

### Error Handling and Status Codes

Error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes are implemented for specific scenarios, including non-existing resources, unauthorized API requests, and invalid data in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests.
